Design a futuristic, immersive, and minimal personal portfolio website for Rishul Chanana. The website should have a sci-fi, elegant Zealy.io-like visual aesthetic — dark mode, glowing gradient shapes, starry sky, and floating UI effects.

🎯 Goal:
To create a clean and impressive personal landing page that introduces who Rishul is and links to his socials — with future sections expandable modularly.

🧩 Website Structure:

1. **Full-Screen Hero Section (Centered)**  
   - Name: “Rishul Chanana” in a large, bold, modern font  
   - Subtitle/bio: “I love to learn new things, I love to host hackathons, and I love to talk to people.”  
   - Button: “Contact Me” — opens a glassmorphism modal with:
     - Email: hello@rishulchanana.com
     - Copy button
     - Optional “Send Email” button
   - All text should animate in smoothly (fade/slide)

2. **Floating Sidebar (Left) — Social Icons with Actual Links**
   - LinkedIn → https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishul-chanana/
   - X (Twitter) → https://x.com/rishhul
   - Instagram → https://instagram.com/chanana_rishul
   - Medium → https://medium.com/@rishulchanana36
   - Email → mailto:hello@rishulchanana.com
   - Style: vertical pill-style container with soft hover glow

3. **Visual Background + Interactions**
   - Background: deep black with a soft nebula gradient (lavender, purple, blue)
   - Animated star field with many scattered twinkling stars
   - Large abstract glowing orbs in 2–3 corners
   - Mouse-follow interaction: stars and blobs shift slightly in response to cursor movement
   - Subtle floating/parallax on all decorative elements
   - Add soft grain or blur texture layer for depth

4. **Styling & Design**
   - Fonts: Futuristic modern sans-serif (e.g., Outfit, Sora, Inter)
   - Effects: glassmorphism for popups, soft ambient glows, subtle button shadows
   - Animation: slow floating orbs, hover scale on icons, smooth modal pop
   - Mobile responsiveness: Social bar collapses to bottom; text and elements reflow

5. **Future-proof Structure**
   - Make the code/layout easy to expand later (e.g., Projects, Blog, Speaking sections)
   - Modular structure — current version is just the landing

🔒 No red, no pixel-art styling. Avoid harsh shadows or neon clutter. The vibe should feel like a builder’s personal space floating in a soft digital cosmos.
